    "Simplified Research Summary Creation – Detailed Format": [
        "Please write a comprehensive and easy-to-understand summary of the provided scientific study in around 600 words. The summary should be informative and written in plain language, suitable for a general audience. It should cover the following areas: Start by explaining the disease — what it is, what causes it, how it affects the body, what symptoms it involves, and what its typical progression looks like. Then, describe the therapy that was studied, including what it is, how it works, and its intended purpose or benefit. Next, provide details about the clinical trial itself: where and how it was conducted, the number of study centers, how many patients were involved, their age ranges, how they were grouped, the length of the study, whether it was blinded, and what outcomes were measured. After that, talk about the treatment experience — how long the treatment lasted, what side effects were reported, and whether any serious side effects occurred. Then, explain how the outcomes were assessed — mention any tests, tools, or evaluation methods that were used. Finally, summarize the results, discussion points, and conclusions from the study. Make sure to highlight any positive or hopeful findings, even if the study had limitations. The tone should be optimistic, clear, and respectful, ensuring accessibility for readers without a medical background.",
        "Please convert the attached research paper into a reader-friendly summary that follows a structured and simple format, using approximately 600 words. Begin with a clear and engaging title that reflects the main topic. Then, briefly explain why the study is important and relevant. Break down the research into key sections: state the main objective or goal of the study, describe how the research was carried out (including the methodology), share the main findings or results, and explain what these results could mean for individuals affected by the condition. Highlight three to four key takeaways using bullet points. Where appropriate, include a simple visual or illustrative idea that can help explain a key aspect of the study in a more accessible way. Conclude by discussing the broader implications of the research or possible next steps. Throughout the summary, use respectful and easy-to-understand language, and define any medical or technical terms in a way that non-specialist readers can follow.Let me know if you'd like both prompts combined into one, or tailored to a specific condition or document."

    "Plain English Research Summary | Full-Depth Overview": [
        "Craft a clear and detailed summary of a pharmaceutical research article using accessible and easy-to-understand language, without compromising on accuracy or depth. Start by extracting and listing important metadata from the document, including its type, publication date, DOI, title, access status, editors, reviewers, correspondence, date of reception, date of acceptance, publication date, citation details, and keywords. Then, provide a brief overview of the research subject — include relevant background information that explains why the study was conducted, the disease or condition being examined, and its overall impact, along with any helpful statistics or context.Next, describe the study setup in simple terms: what kind of study was it (e.g., double-blind, placebo-controlled), how long it lasted, how many participants were involved, their age group, and any inclusion or exclusion criteria. Include what treatment or intervention was studied and whether control groups were used. Mention how the study ensured that researchers and/or participants remained unaware of treatment allocations (blinding).Present the main results of the research using everyday language — talk about the effectiveness of the treatment, differences observed between groups, and highlight any important data or statistical outcomes. Include details about the goals of the study (primary and secondary endpoints), and whether these were achieved. Mention any side effects or health concerns that were observed, along with how they were managed or resolved.Then, explain what these findings mean in the real world. Describe how they could affect patient care, treatment options, or understanding of the condition. Address any study limitations and briefly mention areas where further research may be needed. Finally, wrap up with a short, plain-language recap of the most important takeaways and why they matter. The overall tone should be clear and informative, using simple explanations for any necessary technical terms. Cross-check the summary with the original document to ensure accuracy, and aim for a minimum length of 600 words.",
        "Please create a reader-friendly summary of the provided research paper, using straightforward and respectful language. Organize the summary into the following sections: Start with an Introduction that offers context about the research topic and explains why it’s important. Then outline the Objectives, describing what the research aimed to discover or solve. In the Methodology section, describe how the study was carried out using clear and simple language, avoiding complex or technical terms wherever possible.Next, highlight the Key Findings — focus on the most important results the research uncovered. Follow this with a Significance section, explaining why these findings matter and what they might mean for the medical field or for people affected by the condition. In the Conclusion, talk about what the study suggests, any potential limitations it had, and what future research could focus on.Use active voice and write from the researchers’ perspective (e.g., “we found,” “our study shows”). Avoid scientific jargon, and explain any terms or abbreviations in plain language. Try to answer questions the reader might naturally have, such as what the results mean, how reliable they are, and what the next steps might be. If there are any useful external resources that help explain the context better, mention them. Follow a structured format and aim for a summary of around 600 words."
